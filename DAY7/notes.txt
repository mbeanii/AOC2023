Imagine a list of objects.

Each object has a few properties:
- cards: string[5]
- card_weights: List of 5 ints
- wager: int
- hand: Hand (string name; int value)

We read the input from a file, and store it in a list of objects.

We first iterate through the list, and for each object, we calculate the card weights and hand and store it in the object.

We do a sort first based on hand.value, then based on card_weight[0], then card_weight[1], etc.

We then iterate through the list again, multiplying each weight (len(list) - index) by the wager, and summing the total as we go.

I'll begin by writing the example test.
