Buncha maps

#2 #1 #3

where
#2 is dest start
#1 is source start
#3 is length of interval

Any not mapped get mapped to the same number

Task is to find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seeds.
(first input row)

IN THIS EXAMPLE
Gotta map seed -> soil -> fertilizer -> water -> light -> temperature -> humidity -> location

looking at the puzzle input...
Yeah it's the same.

Blessedly, the inputs are space delinated this time.


Here's the example:

seeds: 79 14 55 13

seed-to-soil map:
50 98 2
52 50 48

soil-to-fertilizer map:
0 15 37
37 52 2
39 0 15

fertilizer-to-water map:
49 53 8
0 11 42
42 0 7
57 7 4

water-to-light map:
88 18 7
18 25 70

light-to-temperature map:
45 77 23
81 45 19
68 64 13

temperature-to-humidity map:
0 69 1
1 0 69

humidity-to-location map:
60 56 37
56 93 4

Expected output is 35.

One way to begin would be by writing the trivial unit test for the above.

Done. Next is to start writing the parser. It should read each map and...
create a list of map objects.

Then the process for following one number all the way through is achieved by
iterating through the list of maps, and for each map, finding the number in the
map that corresponds to the number we're looking for, and then using that number
as the input for the next map.

Test cases for this...
1) should populate the maps property with a list of 7 int:int maps
2) should populate the 'seeds' property with a list of ints (79 14 55 13)
3) The first map (seed-to-soil) should map:
seed  soil
0     0
1     1
...   ...
48    48
49    49
50    52
51    53
...   ...
96    98
97    99
98    50
99    51
4) The maps should be unique
5) Every map should contain at least one unique key/value (ie., not all 1:1, 2:2, etc.)

Ahh! Got it all working for the example. But the real input memory errors.
